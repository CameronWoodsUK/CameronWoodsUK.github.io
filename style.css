/*
class selection > html: class="name-of-class", css: .name-of-class
used when you want to select multiple things

id selection > same as class but with # instead of . in the css
used for just one thing, should be unique

universal selector is just * in the css and selects absolutely everything
should probably avoid bc what's the point when you can select for the body tag

type selection and child selection are self explanatory

look into pseudo classes and pseudo elements if you like
there are specific preset ones for specific kinds of things, like visited links etc

look into box model if having problems with padding and borders and margin etc
margins can overlap, padding cannot

if you want to give specific things widths and heights look into display types

sizing types -
pixels > absolute, will be similar on most devices but can vary
EM/REM > child font size is relative to that of parent
VW/VH > viewport width/height, sizes are relative to size of screen (recommended)
